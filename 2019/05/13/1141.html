    <p>Fabric is out for Minecraft 1.14.1, giving us access to the many performance improvements and bugfixes brought in that version!</p>

<p>With it, I’d like to bring you a brief update of what has changed in the Fabric ecosystem since <a href="https://fabricmc.net/2019/04/23/114.html">the last version update</a>.</p>

<h2 id="users">Users</h2>

<h3 id="mods">Mods</h3>

<p>There are, as of writing, more than 140 mods available on CurseForge for 1.14, and more than 220 available for 1.14 snapshots.</p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind that, due to CurseForge’s delay in adding 1.14 as a selectable category, there were - and potentially still are - unfortunately some mods which were targetting stable 1.14, but were marked as available only for 1.14-Snapshot. We have tried to reach out to developers and ensure this is corrected, and we apologize for any related confusion.</p>

<p>As for 1.14.1 version changes, unfortunately some important breaking changes have been made to block entity registration - we have decided to allow mods to update to them on their own, but this shouldn’t take long.</p>

<h3 id="modpacks">Modpacks</h3>

<p>With 1.14, we released a proof-of-concept modpack called the “LaunchPack”, which showcased some highlights of mods being developed under Fabric. Nowadays, multiple modpacks are available which are based on Fabric, such as <em>Fabric Ultimate</em> and <em>All of Fabric</em>. Unfortunately, they are primarily distributed through our Discord chatrooms and cloud-based downloads.</p>

<p>However! This should begin to change soon - Fabric modpacks can now be distributed not just via MultiMC instances and MCUpdater packs, but also <a href="https://fabricmc.net/wiki/modpack:technic">Technic Solder</a> and <a href="https://fabricmc.net/wiki/modpack:atlauncher">ATLauncher</a>. This should make it much easier to share, play and enjoy Fabric-based modpacks!</p>

<p>There are also a few Fabric-based servers running in production, proving its viability for multiplayer gameplay.</p>

<h3 id="improvements">Improvements</h3>

<p>There were many key fixes done since the 23rd of April of importance to end users, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Realms now works correctly,</li>
  <li>connecting to Spigot/BungeeCord-based servers works correctly (in API 0.3.0+),</li>
  <li>setting up dedicated servers is now much easier than ever before.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these were edge cases we didn’t catch during the snapshot cycle - sorry!</p>

<h2 id="developers">Developers</h2>

<h3 id="fabric-api">Fabric API</h3>

<p>We are aware that the API has been stagnating for a while. However, we have finally finished our big modularization plan with API 0.3.0-pre, and are proceeding to add new features once more.</p>

<h3 id="fabric-loader">Fabric Loader</h3>

<p>We fixed the Heisenbug! The one which caused weird, unexplainable crashes that seemed to “go away” randomly for some people, that is. (It took us far too long and I’m sorry.)</p>

<p>We have also added some features to Mixin centered around better support for interface method injection.</p>

<h3 id="fabric-loom">Fabric Loom</h3>

<p>Loom is now updated to 0.2.3. It provides additional bugfixes in the area of multi-project handling, as well as support for offline builds and - importantly:</p>

<p>A feature to <a href="https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:migratemappings">automatically migrate Java source code to a new mapping version</a>!</p>

<p>We have also documented how to <a href="https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:cursegradle">use CurseGradle with Fabric Loom</a>, for those of you looking into such a feature.</p>
