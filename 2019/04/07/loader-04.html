    <p>I know blog posts (and development) has slowed down recently. I suppose it is fair to attribute this to a burnout on my - asie’s, that is - side. Keeping up a consistent development pace on a hobby project is very
difficult, and it appears I reached my breaking point for a while.</p>

<p>However, today I have finally dusted off old changes and am ready to release the not-perfect-but-nonetheless-good Loader 0.4.0.</p>

<p>The changes are numerous, but include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://fabricmc.net/wiki/format:modjson">New, formalized mod metadata schema format!</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Now with a proper modder-side API!</li>
      <li>Actual versioning and dependency resolution!</li>
      <li>More powerful entrypoint system to replace initiailizers! Provide static fields and even method handles!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Nested JARs, cooperating with said dependency resolution to allow you to provide any dependency you want - leave the rest to the mod loader!</li>
  <li>Support for a <em>lot</em> of Minecraft versions. For now, we support:
    <ul>
      <li>All vanilla client and server versions, from 0.0.11 all the way to 19w14b - and beyond!</li>
      <li>All versions of Risguami’s ModLoader*,</li>
      <li>Versions of Forge for 1.2.5 and below*.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mixin reference maps are now remapped at runtime in development environment dependencies.
    <ul>
      <li>This removes a bunch of Loom-side hackery, and finally fixes Accessor/Invoker support in this scenario!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Major refactors in Knot, our default class loader.
    <ul>
      <li>Stub providing of Package/CodeSource objects - fixing a few crashes here and there.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The server .JAR filename is now stored in a properties file - this is useful for better interop with many existing server hosting systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that the ModLoader/Forge support (a) requires enabling a flag for a “compatibility” class loader mode, (b) does not yet allow you to mixin non-Fabric mods themselves. However, it <em>does</em> work on Java 9+!</p>

<p>As for mod compatibility, most mods should work just fine - there is a decent amount of 0.3.x compatibility. However, there are some exceptions we’re aware of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mod Menu</strong> may run into issues during gameplay, but basic functionality works fine.</li>
  <li><strong>plugin-loader</strong> does not work with 0.4.x! Disable it in your instance and encourage your local mod author to adopt entrypoints in its place - they’re as good if not better.</li>
</ul>

<p>With regards to modders, there are some scribbled notes on updating to Loader 0.4.x <a href="https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:loader04x">right here</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you will enjoy the new, long-awaited features in Loader! What’s coming next?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Loom 0.3.0 is still being worked on. It probably won’t come out in a day or two, but should be out soon-ish. As a stop-gap, Loom 0.2.1 is being worked on by modmuss50 to add nested JAR functionality to your existing development environments.</li>
  <li>There is renewed debate and implementation work on the configuration system. Hopefully, it will make it to Loader 0.5.0.</li>
  <li>There are discussions on the future of Fabric’s API component - nothing concrete to announce as of yet. We are aware of its mild stagnation, don’t worry!</li>
</ul>

<p>PS. How’s Yarn doing?</p>
