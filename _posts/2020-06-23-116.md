The long anticipated Minecraft 1.16 update has arrived, and along with it, Fabric!

It has been almost **a year and a half** since we [initially unveiled Fabric on the 10th of December, 2018](https://fabricmc.net/2018/12/10/announcement.html). Since then, the world has changed in many ways, and so has Fabric. Since the Minecraft 1.15 update over six months ago, Fabric has:

- Updated to every single snapshot along the way to allow developers to explore the new versions
- Continued to add many new APIs allowing for easier mod making and mod inter-compatibility

Developers, make sure to check out our [June Status Update](https://fabricmc.net/2020/06/08/jun-status-update.html) from a couple weeks ago to learn more about how Fabric has progressed internally over the past six months.

## Community <!-- Player oriented, so maybe tell them where to grab fresh mods! -->
