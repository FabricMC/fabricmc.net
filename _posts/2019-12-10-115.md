# Fabric for Minecraft 1.15

A year ago today we first [announced](https://fabricmc.net/2018/12/10/announcement.html) Fabric for Minecraft 18w49a since then we have updated to 76 different Minecraft versions:

* 1 April Fools
* 3 Combat Tests
* 5 Stable releases
* 67 Snapshots

A lot of work has been put into fabric to keep it up to date, as well as some of the improvements we covered in the [November Status Update](https://fabricmc.net/2019/11/19/nov-status-update.html).


## Modpacks
As of publishing this post, there are already two major modpacks ready to play on 1.15 pre-releases or final 1.15. Both of the packs are released via [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) Instances.


### Bee Merry

Bee Merry is a festive mod pack that provides a unique experience in the snow. A lot of mods have been tweaked and customised in ways never seen before. It's a great example of how fabric can be used to create curated modpacks for a great single or multiplayer experience. 

Bee Merry can be downloaded as a MulitMC instance from [here](http://bouf.hoborific.com:8080/bee_merry) or the `#releases` channel in the fabric discord server.

### All Of Fabric 2

All of Fabric has been a staple modpack in 1.14 and is back again for 1.15! AOF contains a wide selection of fabric mods that should appeal to everyone's taste. AOF is regularly updated to include new mods as they become available

All of Fabric 2 can be downloaded as a MultiMC instance from their [GitHub](https://github.com/AllOfFabric/AOF-2/releases).
