This repository contains the source code and content for [https://fabricmc.net/](https://fabricmc.net/). Jekyll is used as the static site generator. A small TypeScript Svelte project located in /scripts powers the interactive parts of the site.

## Develop using Docker dev container.

Install Docker and VSCode on the host, no need to install NodeJS or Ruby on the host.

* Open dev container with vscode
* Run `bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve` in a terminal
* In a second terminal, run: `cd scripts`, `npm i`, `npm run dev`
* http://localhost:4000/

## Build
### Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Ruby 2.7 *with* DevKit](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)

### Install Jekyll

Ensure that the Ruby dependencies are installed locally, not system-wide:

```
bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
bundle install 
```

From then on, run Jekyll using `bundle exec jekyll <args>` to use the local version.

### Build JavaScript Assets

Install the JavaScript dependencies by running `npm install` in the `javascript` subdirectory.

Then build the JavaScript bundle using `npm run build`.

### Build Site

```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

This will build the site into the `_site` folder.

### Developing the Site

To run a local development server to more comfortably edit the site, run:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then open http://localhost:4000 in your browser of choice. The site should update automatically as you change the files.

## Docker

Used to build and run a production like server.

* `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t fabricmc-net .`
* `docker run -p 8080:80 fabricmc.net`
* `http://localhost:8080/`
