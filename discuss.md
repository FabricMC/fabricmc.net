### users, modders

For users/modders, the accepted and preferred means of communication are Discord servers. As such, for most Fabric-related discussions and announcements, you can use [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).

### core development

To contact the core developers of Fabric and discuss matters pertaining to the development process, as well as to ask the difficult questions, you can use the following means:

* the issue trackers on [Fabric repositories](https://github.com/FabricMC), or
* the #fabric IRC channel at EsperNet (irc.esper.net). You can access it using an IRC client (such as [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io/)) or by [using a web browser](https://webchat.esper.net/).
